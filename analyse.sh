echo -e "\nSummary of Enhancements:"
echo "1. Multi-Source ZK Circuit: Added support for validating multiple quantum sources"
echo "   - Supports up to 5 different quantum key sources"
echo "   - Implements threshold validation (require at least N valid sources)"
echo "   - Generates secure combined commitment for consensus"

echo "2. VRF Implementation: Added Verifiable Random Function for deterministic randomness"
echo "   - Uses ZK proof output as seed"
echo "   - Provides provable, fair random values"
echo "   - Supports leader election and committee selection"

echo "3. Byzantine Integration: Connected ZK proofs with Byzantine consensus"
echo "   - MultiSourceProofGenerator aggregates reports from multiple nodes"
echo "   - ZK proofs can validate Byzantine consensus outputs"
echo "   - VRF provides unbiased random source for consensus"

echo -e "\nNext Steps:"
echo "1. Test circuit generation with 'snarkjs' CLI tool"
echo "2. Run multi-source proof demo to verify functionality"
echo "3. Integrate with existing reporter nodes"
echo "4. Create automated tests for the enhanced ZK components"
