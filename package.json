  "description": "QKD Client (Rust + PKCS#12 + CA) This repository demonstrates how to securely request keys from a QKD server (or other quantum-safe endpoint) using PKCS#12-based client certificates in Rust. The implementation includes JSON response parsing for key retrieval (e.g., key_ID, key). Overview The client connects to a KMS or QKD endpoint at https://<ip>/api/v1/keys/... using mutual TLS authentication with client certificates. Security Considerations",
