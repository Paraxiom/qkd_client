# QKD Reporter Node

## Overview
The QKD Reporter Node is a quantum-resistant reporting system that integrates with QKD networks to provide secure key reporting with zero-knowledge proof verification.


## Performance Metrics
Current performance benchmarks:
- Key Retrieval: ~110ms
- Proof Generation: ~770ms
- Verification: ~496ms
- Total Processing Time: ~1.4 seconds

## Components

### QKD Client
- Handles secure communication with QKD network
- Certificate-based authentication
- Quantum-resistant proof generation
- Error handling and retry logic

### Zero-Knowledge Proof System
- Circom circuit integration
- Proof generation and verification
- Quantum-resistant security guarantees

### Metrics Collection
- Performance monitoring
- Timing measurements
- System health checks

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cargo build
```

2. Configure certificates:
```bash
# Place certificates in
/certificate/Toshiba/certs/client_alice.p12
/certificate/Toshiba/certs/ca_crt.pem
```

3. Run the reporter:
```bash
cargo run --bin qkd_client
```

```

## Performance Optimization

The system is designed for parallel processing:
- Concurrent key retrieval
- Asynchronous proof generation
- Parallel verification

## Security Considerations

1. Quantum Resistance
   - ZK proof system quantum-resistant
   - Uses quantum-safe cryptographic primitives

2. Authentication
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Quantum authentication proofs

3. Key Management
   - Secure key storage
   - Ephemeral key handling
